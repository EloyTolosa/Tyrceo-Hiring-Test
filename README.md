# Tyrceo-Hiring-Test
This is my approach to solve the problem mentioned [here](https://github.com/Tyrceo/Hiring-Test-Instructions).

# To run the test
I have put an requirements.txt, and with that I've created a Pipfile and Pipfile.lock files so you can run the virtual environment. The requirements.txt file is just in case something hapens and you need to create the Pipfile files yourselves.

After you have run the program, you will have the points.geojson file created. In order to make the project work, you need to copy and paste the file into the "visualization" folder, and create a local server with the command "python -m http.server". After that, you can go to the localhost on your machine and you will see the map with the result of the test.
